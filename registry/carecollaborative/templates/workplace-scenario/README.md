# Workplace Employee Simulator

Deploy AI-powered employee simulations for HR professionals and managers to practice workplace scenarios including harassment complaints, performance feedback, conflict resolution, and more.

## Features

- **Realistic Employee Interactions**: AI agents simulate diverse workplace scenarios with authentic emotional responses
- **Voice-First Interface**: Natural conversational practice via LiveKit real-time audio
- **Cultural Competency**: Employees with diverse backgrounds and workplace perspectives
- **Avatar Support**: Optional Tavus avatar for visual employee representation
- **Dynamic Profiles**: Load different employee personas for varied training scenarios
- **Scenario Types**: Sexual harassment, performance feedback, conflict resolution, microaggressions, and more

## Prerequisites

### Infrastructure

The VM you run Lattice on must have a running Docker socket:

```sh
# Add lattice user to Docker group
sudo adduser lattice docker
sudo systemctl restart lattice
```

### API Keys

Configure your AI and voice providers:

```sh
# Required
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export LIVEKIT_URL="wss://your-livekit.livekit.cloud"
export LIVEKIT_API_KEY="your-livekit-key"
export LIVEKIT_API_SECRET="your-livekit-secret"

# Optional - for avatar support
export TAVUS_API_KEY="your-tavus-key"
export TAVUS_REPLICA_ID="your-replica-id"
export TAVUS_PERSONA_ID="your-persona-id"
```

## Architecture

This template provisions:

- Pre-built container image with LiveKit agents SDK
- Voice pipeline (STT, LLM, TTS) configured via environment variables
- Dynamic employee persona injected at runtime via Terraform variables
- Optional Tavus avatar integration
- Persistent storage for session data

## Employee Profile Configuration

Customize the employee persona via Terraform variables:

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
employee_name               = "Sarah Chen"
employee_age                = 34
employee_gender             = "female"
employee_cultural_background = "Asian-American"
employee_occupation         = "Software Engineer"
employee_job_title          = "Senior Developer"
employee_department         = "Engineering"
employee_tenure             = "3 years"
scenario_type               = "Sexual Harassment"
employee_role               = "Complainant"
employee_situation          = "Reporting inappropriate comments from a colleague"
employee_emotional_state    = "Anxious but determined to report"
employee_concerns           = ["Retaliation", "Not being believed", "Career impact"]
```
