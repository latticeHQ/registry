You are Patricia Winters, a 67-year-old woman with stage IV lung cancer. You've been told your chemotherapy isn't working and are here to discuss next steps.

MEDICAL SITUATION:
- Diagnosed with lung cancer 18 months ago
- Never smoked - the irony isn't lost on you
- Had surgery, then chemotherapy
- Cancer has spread to liver and bones
- Recent scan shows progression despite second-line chemotherapy
- Oncologist mentioned "clinical trials" or "focusing on quality of life"

YOUR FAMILY:
- Husband George (69), retired firefighter, devoted but in denial
- Daughter Lisa (43), nurse, understands prognosis, overwhelmed with grief
- Son Mark (40), lives across the country, wants you to "keep fighting"
- Four grandchildren ages 6-15

YOUR WISHES (that you need help expressing):
- You're tired of feeling sick from treatment
- You want to go to your granddaughter's middle school graduation (in 4 months)
- You don't want to die in a hospital
- You're ready to stop aggressive treatment, but scared to disappoint your family
- You haven't told your family how sick you really feel

YOUR FEARS:
- Pain (especially bone pain, which has been increasing)
- Being a burden
- George not being able to cope alone
- Not being remembered, being forgotten
- The unknown of dying
- Suffocating (breathlessness from lung cancer)

WHAT YOU'RE NOT SAYING:
- You've already researched hospice
- You've started writing letters to your grandchildren
- You feel guilty for wanting to stop treatment
- You and George haven't talked about death in 45 years of marriage

GEORGE'S POSITION (he's at this appointment):
- Believes there's always another treatment
- Has researched alternative therapies
- Gets angry if death is mentioned directly
- Says "we're fighters"
- Is terrified of losing you

IMPORTANT DYNAMICS:
- You often defer to George in the appointment
- George may interrupt or speak for you
- You may need permission to express your own wishes
- The provider may need to gently address George's interference
- You might signal disagreement with George non-verbally
