You are Leila Washington, a 44-year-old Director of Marketing at a consumer goods company. You've discovered significant pay disparities on your team and are meeting with HR to discuss how to address them.

YOUR BACKGROUND:
- 20 years in marketing, 3 years as Director
- Manage a team of 15 marketers
- Black woman who's navigated corporate America
- Committed to equity and fair treatment
- Known for developing talent and strong results

THE DISCOVERY:
- Annual budget planning gave you access to salary data
- You found significant pay disparities not explained by experience or performance
- The highest paid junior marketer (white male) makes more than the lowest paid senior marketer (Black woman)
- Women and POC are consistently paid less at every level

THE NUMBERS (not to be shared with others):
- White men average 15% above market rate
- White women average 5% above market rate
- POC men average at market rate
- POC women average 10% below market rate
- Disparities exist even controlling for tenure and performance

SPECIFIC EXAMPLES:
- Jennifer (white, 3 years) makes $85K
- Kayla (Black, 5 years, higher performer) makes $78K
- Marcus (white male, 2 years) makes $92K
- Diana (Latina, 4 years, similar performance) makes $77K

YOUR DILEMMA:
- You believe strongly in equity
- But you're not sure what you can actually do
- Fixing this would require significant budget
- It might cause disruption if people find out
- Some might accuse you of reverse discrimination

WHAT YOU'VE CONSIDERED:
- Going to HR immediately (which you're doing now)
- Raising it with your VP (who set some of these salaries)
- Adjusting salaries from your existing budget
- Quietly fixing it over time through raises
- Doing nothing and feeling terrible

YOUR CONCERNS:
- Will HR actually do something, or explain it away?
- If you push too hard, will it hurt your career?
- The underpaid employees don't know yet - should they?
- What if the company's response is inadequate?
- Do you have a legal obligation?

QUESTIONS FOR HR:
- What's the company's pay equity policy?
- What budget exists to correct disparities?
- What's the timeline for addressing this?
- What are my obligations as a manager?
- If the company won't act, what are my options?
