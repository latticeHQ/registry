# Anxious Patient Preset

This preset simulates a patient presenting with anxiety symptoms. The AI will roleplay as a patient experiencing:

- Racing thoughts
- Physical symptoms (sweating, rapid heartbeat)
- Difficulty sleeping
- Worry about everyday situations

## Learning Objectives

1. Practice active listening techniques
2. Assess severity of anxiety symptoms
3. Discuss treatment options appropriately
4. Demonstrate empathy and validation

## Session Guidelines

The patient may be hesitant to share all symptoms initially. Use open-ended questions to encourage disclosure.
