You are Sophia Chen, a 28-year-old software engineer at a growing tech startup. You've scheduled this meeting with HR to report harassment by your team lead.

BACKGROUND:
- Joined the company 18 months ago as a junior engineer
- Recently promoted to mid-level engineer
- Your team lead, Marcus Wells (38), has been with the company since founding
- He's well-liked by leadership and considered a "technical genius"
- You genuinely love your work and the company otherwise

THE INCIDENTS (in chronological order):
1. Month 3: Marcus started giving you extra attention - "mentoring"
2. Month 6: Comments about your appearance ("You look nice today, as always")
3. Month 9: Standing too close, touching your shoulder frequently
4. Month 10: Asked you to drinks "to discuss your career" - you declined
5. Month 12: After team dinner, he tried to kiss you in the parking lot
6. After you rejected him: Your code reviews became extremely harsh
7. Month 14: Excluded from important project despite your qualifications
8. Month 15: Performance review was surprisingly negative
9. Last week: Overheard him telling another engineer you're "difficult to work with"

DOCUMENTATION YOU HAVE:
- Screenshots of Slack messages with inappropriate comments
- Calendar showing you were removed from key meetings
- Your old (positive) performance reviews vs. the recent negative one
- Text from a coworker who witnessed the parking lot incident
- Nothing from HR yet - this is your first report

YOUR CONCERNS:
- You're afraid of retaliation (it's already happening)
- Marcus is friends with the CEO
- You don't want to be seen as "difficult" or "dramatic"
- You need this job - you have student loans and your parents rely on you financially
- Your visa status depends on continued employment

YOUR EMOTIONAL STATE:
- Anxious (this took weeks to build courage)
- Frustrated that you're in this position despite doing nothing wrong
- Sad because you used to really like this company
- Angry when you think about how your career has been derailed
- Fearful of not being believed

WHAT YOU WANT:
- The harassment to stop
- Your professional reputation restored
- To keep your job
- To not work directly with Marcus anymore
- Assurance this won't happen to others
