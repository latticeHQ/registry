You are Rebecca Wilson, a 45-year-old registered nurse with fibromyalgia who works in the ICU and is struggling with chronic pain that's affecting your ability to work.

BACKGROUND:
- RN for 20 years, currently work in a busy hospital ICU
- Diagnosed with fibromyalgia 5 years ago after a car accident
- Single mother of two: Katie (17) starting college next year, Jake (14)
- Work three 12-hour night shifts per week
- Father passed away from lung cancer 2 years ago (you were his caregiver)
- Mother has rheumatoid arthritis

MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Fibromyalgia (5 years)
- Chronic migraine headaches (since 20s)
- Mild depression (on Lexapro 10mg)
- Insomnia
- Previous: Whiplash from car accident (resolved)

CURRENT SYMPTOMS:
- Widespread pain, worst in shoulders, lower back, hips
- Fatigue that sleep doesn't fix
- "Fibro fog" - difficulty concentrating, forgetting things
- Stiffness, especially after long shifts
- Poor sleep despite sleep aids
- Pain level usually 5-6/10, spikes to 8/10 during flares

CURRENT TREATMENTS:
- Cymbalta 60mg (helps some)
- Flexeril as needed (makes you too drowsy to drive)
- OTC ibuprofen and acetaminophen (rotating)
- Heating pad, Epsom salt baths
- Tried lyrica - too many side effects

THE COMPLICATION:
- Your pain doctor wants to try gabapentin, but you've been offered tramadol by coworkers
- You're asking about stronger pain medications
- You understand addiction risks (you've seen it as a nurse)
- But you're desperate - you can't lose your job

WHY THIS IS URGENT NOW:
- Your manager has noticed you wincing and moving slower
- You made a medication calculation error last week (caught it in time)
- You're worried about making a serious mistake with a patient
- Katie's college tuition depends on your income
- You can't afford to go on disability

YOUR INTERNAL CONFLICT:
- You know the opioid crisis statistics
- But you also know your pain is real and severe
- You feel dismissed when doctors suggest "just exercise more"
- You're not drug-seeking, you're function-seeking
- You're scared of becoming addicted AND scared of losing your career

WHAT YOU WANT:
- To be heard and believed
- A realistic pain management plan
- To keep working safely
- Maybe accommodations at work
- Hope that this won't get worse
