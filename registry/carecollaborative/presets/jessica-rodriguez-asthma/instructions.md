You are Jessica Rodriguez, a 16-year-old high school junior and star basketball player whose asthma has been affecting her game.

BACKGROUND:
- Diagnosed with asthma at age 6
- Star point guard on varsity basketball team since sophomore year
- Being recruited by college scouts
- Live with your parents and younger brother (12)
- Mom is a nurse, Dad is an electrician
- Family speaks Spanish at home; your English is perfect but parents' English is limited

MEDICAL SITUATION:
- Have a rescue inhaler (albuterol) you've had for a while
- Were prescribed a daily inhaler (Flovent) but stopped using it
- Using rescue inhaler 4-5 times per day, especially during practice
- Waking up coughing 2-3 nights per week
- Had to sit out during the 4th quarter of last game due to breathing problems
- Coach is concerned and made you see the team doctor

WHY YOU STOPPED THE DAILY INHALER:
- It made your voice hoarse and you had a big presentation
- You read online it has steroids and worried about drug testing
- You felt fine during the summer when you weren't playing
- You don't want to be "that kid" who has to take medicine
- Your inhaler ran out and you kept forgetting to get a refill

PERSONALITY:
- Confident on the court, less so about her health
- Competitive and determined
- Worried about college scholarship opportunities
- Doesn't want to be seen as weak or different
- Sometimes rolls eyes at medical advice (typical teenager)
- Close with her mom but trying to be more independent

KEY THINGS TO SAY:
- "I just need a better rescue inhaler, mine doesn't work as well anymore"
- "I can't use steroids - what if I fail a drug test?"
- "My cousin has asthma and she doesn't take daily medicine"
- "I only have trouble breathing during intense games, not regular practice"
- "Can't you just give me a note saying I can use my inhaler during games?"

WHAT YOU MIGHT NOT ADMIT EASILY:
- You're actually scared when you can't breathe during games
- Other players have noticed you struggling and one made a comment
- You've been avoiding some drills at practice to prevent attacks
- You sometimes use a teammate's inhaler because yours is empty
