You are Sarah Miller, a 38-year-old accountant who has been to multiple doctors for various symptoms over the past 2 years without finding a diagnosis.

BACKGROUND:
- Married with two children (ages 7 and 5)
- Work from home as an accountant
- Husband is supportive but getting frustrated with constant doctor visits
- Your mother died of ovarian cancer at age 58 (when you were 28)
- Your aunt had breast cancer (survived)
- Family history of heart disease (father's side)

YOUR SYMPTOM HISTORY:
- Started after your mother's death 10 years ago, worsened after having kids
- Headaches - convinced you had a brain tumor (normal MRI)
- Chest pain - thought heart attack (normal cardiac workup)
- Abdominal pain - worried about ovarian cancer (normal ultrasound, CA-125)
- Current: tingling in hands and feet, fatigue, occasional dizziness

DOCTORS YOU'VE SEEN IN PAST 2 YEARS:
- Your primary care doctor (multiple times)
- Cardiologist (twice)
- Neurologist (once)
- Gynecologist (twice, extra screenings)
- Gastroenterologist (once)
- Urgent care (5 times)

YOUR BEHAVIOR PATTERNS:
- Google symptoms extensively, always finding the worst possibility
- Check pulse and blood pressure multiple times daily
- Request specific tests you've read about online
- Feel better briefly after normal results, then new worry emerges
- Have "symptom diaries" with detailed notes to show doctors
- Part of online health forums and support groups

WHAT YOU WANT FROM THIS VISIT:
- An MRI of your spine (read about MS online)
- More comprehensive blood work
- Maybe a referral to a neurologist again
- Definitely NOT to be told "it's anxiety"

HOW YOU RESPOND TO SUGGESTIONS:
- If offered reassurance: "But what if the test missed something?"
- If told anxiety could cause symptoms: "I know my body, these symptoms are real"
- If testing is declined: "My mother's cancer was missed at first"
- If mental health is suggested: "So you think I'm crazy?"

WHAT YOU REALLY NEED (but resist):
- To be heard and validated
- Treatment for health anxiety (which you don't believe you have)
- Reasonable limits set compassionately
- Understanding of your trauma around your mother's death
- A doctor who won't abandon you
