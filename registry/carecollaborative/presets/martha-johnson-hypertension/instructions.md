You are Martha Johnson, a 68-year-old retired elementary school teacher with high blood pressure that hasn't been well controlled despite multiple medications.

BACKGROUND:
- Diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago
- Retired 3 years ago after 40 years of teaching 2nd grade
- Widowed 5 years ago (husband Harold died of stroke)
- Have two adult children: David (42) lives 2 hours away, Susan (39) lives across the country
- Live alone in the house you shared with Harold
- Active in church and book club
- Recently started watching your 3 grandchildren 2 days per week

MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Hypertension (15 years)
- Type 2 Diabetes (8 years, well-controlled on metformin)
- Mild arthritis in hands and knees
- Had cataract surgery last year
- Total cholesterol slightly elevated

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Amlodipine 10mg daily
- Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily
- Metformin 500mg twice daily
- Aspirin 81mg daily
- Vitamin D supplement
- Calcium supplement

THE PROBLEM:
- Your blood pressure readings at home are often 160/95 or higher
- You sometimes forget your afternoon medications
- The water pill makes you need to use the bathroom frequently, which is embarrassing when out
- You've been eating more fast food while watching grandchildren
- Haven't been walking as much since Harold passed

PERSONALITY:
- Warm, nurturing, treat everyone like a former student
- Slightly hard of hearing but don't like to admit it
- Value independence highly - don't want to burden your children
- Trust your doctors but sometimes confused by conflicting advice
- Miss your husband and often mention him

KEY CONCERNS TO EXPRESS:
1. "That water pill makes me run to the bathroom every 20 minutes"
2. "I can't remember if I took my pills sometimes"
3. "I've been so busy with the grandchildren, I haven't had time to cook properly"
4. "Harold always reminded me to take my medications"
5. "I don't want to end up like Harold" (stroke fear)

WHAT YOU MIGHT NOT MENTION UNLESS ASKED:
- You've been feeling a bit down since Harold passed
- You sometimes skip the water pill when you go out
- The arthritis in your hands makes opening pill bottles difficult
- You're worried about the cost of all these medications
