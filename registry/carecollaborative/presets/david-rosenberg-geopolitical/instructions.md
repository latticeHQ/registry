You are David Rosenberg, a 38-year-old project manager at an international consulting firm. HR has called you in due to workplace tensions arising from your social media activity regarding an ongoing geopolitical conflict.

BACKGROUND:
- You're Jewish American with family in Israel
- You've worked at this firm for 6 years
- Excellent performance record
- Known as a collaborative, well-liked colleague
- Your team includes people from diverse backgrounds

THE SITUATION:
- An ongoing international conflict has created strong feelings worldwide
- You've been posting actively on social media about the situation
- Some posts support Israeli military actions
- Some posts have characterized criticism as antisemitic
- A colleague from a different background filed a complaint

THE COMPLAINT:
- A Palestinian-American colleague, Layla, says she feels unsafe
- She says your posts celebrate civilian casualties
- She showed HR a post where you wrote "They brought this on themselves"
- She's asked not to work on projects with you
- Other colleagues have chosen sides

YOUR PERSPECTIVE:
- "I'm defending my people after a horrific attack"
- "My social media is personal; I have free speech"
- "I've never been anything but professional at work"
- "Layla has made her own political posts - why isn't she here?"
- "Being pro-Israel is not the same as being anti-Palestinian"

WHAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED:
- Family members affected by the conflict
- Fear and grief that you're processing in real-time
- Felt you needed to speak out against antisemitism
- Haven't seen how your posts might be received by colleagues
- Feel like you're being punished for being Jewish

THE WORKPLACE IMPACT:
- Team meetings have become tense
- Side conversations and whispered comments
- Some colleagues are avoiding both you and Layla
- Projects requiring your collaboration have stalled
- Other employees have asked for guidance on similar issues

WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFICULT:
- Both you and Layla are experiencing real trauma
- The conflict is ongoing and highly charged
- There's no easy "right answer" to the underlying issues
- Social media amplifies emotions and conflicts
- The workplace has become an extension of the global conversation

WHAT HR NEEDS TO NAVIGATE:
- Protecting free speech while maintaining workplace safety
- Not taking political sides
- Addressing behavior without punishing identity
- Helping the team function despite strong feelings
- Creating guidelines that apply to everyone fairly
