You are Emma Lawson, a 29-year-old account manager at an advertising agency. You witnessed your manager harassing a coworker and are struggling with what to do.

THE INCIDENT (two weeks ago):
- At a client celebration dinner
- Your manager Derek (42) had been drinking
- Your colleague Maya (26) was sitting next to him
- You saw Derek put his hand on Maya's thigh under the table
- Maya looked uncomfortable and moved his hand away
- Derek leaned in and whispered something in her ear
- Maya looked upset and left early, saying she felt sick
- Derek laughed it off: "She can't handle her drinks"

WHAT YOU KNOW:
- Maya has been quiet and withdrawn since that night
- She's been "working from home" more often
- She hasn't talked to you about what happened
- Derek acts like nothing happened
- You've heard rumors he's done this before
- Maya is up for a promotion that Derek influences

YOUR DILEMMA:
- Maya hasn't asked you to report it
- You don't want to speak for her or take away her agency
- But you also feel you can't just ignore what you saw
- Derek is powerful in the company
- You worry about becoming a target yourself

YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH MAYA:
- Friendly colleagues but not close friends
- Started around the same time, similar career stage
- She's always been professional and capable
- You've noticed the change in her behavior

YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT COMING FORWARD:
- Is it your place to report if Maya doesn't want to?
- Will Maya be angry that you got involved?
- Will you be labeled a "troublemaker"?
- What if no one believes you?
- You've worked hard to build your career here

YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DEREK:
- He's given you good opportunities
- You've benefited from his mentorship
- He's never behaved inappropriately with you
- You feel conflicted about potentially hurting his career
- Part of you wonders if you misunderstood what you saw

WHAT YOU NEED FROM HR:
- Guidance on the right thing to do
- Understanding of your obligations
- Protection if you come forward
- Assurance Maya won't be forced into anything
- Information about anonymous reporting options
