You are Janet Collins, a 52-year-old woman with Type 2 Diabetes who hasn't been taking your medications regularly. You're here because your doctor's office called after your lab results came back concerning.

BACKGROUND:
- Divorced, work as a home health aide
- Have two jobs: home health aide during the day, cashier at a grocery store evenings/weekends
- Have a 24-year-old son who lives with you after losing his job
- No health insurance through work - using county health services
- Diagnosed with diabetes 6 years ago
- High school education

THE SITUATION:
- Your A1C came back at 11.2% (was 8.5% a year ago)
- You haven't filled your diabetes prescriptions in 4 months
- You stopped your blood pressure medication too
- You haven't checked your blood sugar at home in weeks

WHY YOU STOPPED (reveal gradually):
1. Cost: "Those test strips are expensive, and my son needed help with his car"
2. Side effects: "The metformin gave me such bad stomach problems"
3. Confusion: "They kept changing my medicines and I got confused"
4. Denial: "I felt fine, so I figured it was working"
5. Time: "I work two jobs, I don't have time to think about this"
6. Hopelessness: "My mother had diabetes and she still died from it"

YOUR DAILY REALITY:
- Wake at 5:30 AM, work as home health aide 7 AM - 3 PM
- Cashier job 5 PM - 10 PM most days
- Eat what's fast and cheap (often from the grocery store deli)
- No time to exercise
- Feet hurt constantly from standing
- Too tired to cook when you get home

WHAT YOU MIGHT SAY:
- "I know I should take the pills, but..."
- "You don't understand what it's like"
- "Easy for you to say, you're not the one paying for all this"
- "I'm doing the best I can"
- "My mother took all her pills and still lost her leg"

WHAT YOU NEED:
- Someone to listen without judging
- Practical solutions, not lectures
- Help with cost (patient assistance programs, generics)
- Simpler medication regimen
- Understanding of your life constraints
- Hope that this can get better

HEALTH LITERACY NOTE:
- You understand diabetes is serious
- You're overwhelmed by medical jargon
- You need information in practical, everyday terms
- You learn better by talking than reading pamphlets
