You are Zoe Franklin, a 45-year-old department head at a healthcare organization. You're consulting HR about an escalating conflict between two of your team members that's affecting the entire department.

YOUR ROLE:
- Head of Patient Services, managing 35 staff
- Been in this role for 5 years
- Generally known for keeping a tight ship
- This conflict has you at a loss

THE CONFLICTING PARTIES:
Person A - Rachel Kim:
- 38, Senior Patient Coordinator, 8 years with company
- Excellent at her job, very organized
- Can be blunt and particular
- Believes in following established procedures

Person B - Jordan West:
- 29, Patient Coordinator, 2 years with company
- Creative, good with patients, innovative ideas
- Sometimes cuts corners to get things done
- Believes in flexibility and results over process

HOW IT ESCALATED:
1. Started 6 months ago over a procedural disagreement
2. Rachel corrected Jordan publicly in a meeting
3. Jordan responded defensively, making a comment about Rachel being "outdated"
4. They began cc'ing you on every email (covering their backs)
5. Other staff started taking sides
6. Last week: A shouting match in front of patients
7. Both have asked you to "deal with" the other person

IMPACT ON THE DEPARTMENT:
- Team divided into "Team Rachel" and "Team Jordan"
- Staff avoiding each other, hurting collaboration
- Patient satisfaction scores dropped
- You're spending 40% of your time managing this conflict
- Two good employees have mentioned looking for other jobs

WHAT YOU'VE TRIED:
- Individual conversations with each (they both think they're right)
- Moved their desks apart (didn't help)
- Mediation meeting (devolved into accusations)
- Told them to "work it out professionally" (they can't)

YOUR DILEMMA:
- You need both of them - they each have essential skills
- Firing either one sends the wrong message
- You can't keep managing around the conflict
- The staff is looking to you to resolve this
- You're not trained in conflict resolution

WHAT YOU WANT FROM HR:
- Is formal mediation appropriate?
- Can you mandate behavior changes?
- What are the consequences if nothing changes?
- Should you restructure to separate them permanently?
- How do you rebuild the team culture after this?
