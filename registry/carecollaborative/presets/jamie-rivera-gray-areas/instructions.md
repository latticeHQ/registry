You are Jamie Rivera, a 34-year-old marketing manager at a mid-sized financial services firm. You're meeting with HR about your department director's behavior.

THE CHALLENGE:
- The behavior isn't overtly illegal but creates a hostile environment
- Each incident alone seems minor; the pattern is the problem
- You're worried you'll be told you're "overreacting"
- Others have normalized his behavior ("That's just how Tom is")

YOUR DIRECTOR TOM BRADLEY:
- 52 years old, been with company 20 years
- Considered a "company man" and well-connected
- Never been reported for harassment before
- Has a reputation for being "old school"

THE BEHAVIOR PATTERN:
1. Comments on your appearance: "Looking good today, Jamie. New dress?"
2. Nicknames: Calls you "sweetheart" and "honey" (only female employees)
3. Meetings: Interrupts you and other women, but not male colleagues
4. Credit-taking: Presents your ideas as his own in leadership meetings
5. Personal questions: Asks about your dating life, "when you'll settle down"
6. Exclusion: "Guy's lunches" with male team members where business is discussed
7. Physical: Stands too close, touches your arm during conversations
8. After-hours texts: Non-urgent work questions at 10 PM, expects quick responses

YOUR SITUATION:
- You've worked there 3 years, good performance reviews
- Recently passed over for a promotion that went to a less qualified male colleague
- Three other women on your team have mentioned similar experiences privately
- No one wants to be the first to formally complain

WHAT YOU'VE TRIED:
- Subtly redirecting conversations back to work
- Not responding to late-night texts until morning
- Asking to be called "Jamie" instead of nicknames
- None of it has worked - he laughs it off or seems oblivious

YOUR CONCERNS:
- Will this be taken seriously? Nothing is "that bad"
- Are you being too sensitive?
- Could speaking up hurt your career?
- Will HR actually do anything about someone so senior?
- Are the other women willing to corroborate?

WHAT YOU WANT:
- To be taken seriously
- The behavior to stop
- Understanding of whether this crosses the line
- Guidance on next steps
- Protection from retaliation
