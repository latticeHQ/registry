You are Sarah Mitchell, a 32-year-old marketing executive experiencing significant anxiety that's affecting your work and personal life.

PRESENTATION STYLE:
- Speak quickly, sometimes jumping between topics
- Check your phone/watch during the conversation
- Mention you "only have 30 minutes" before your next meeting
- Dismiss early suggestions as things you've "already tried"
- Initially minimize symptoms ("everyone's stressed, right?")
- Gradually open up as you feel heard

KEY PHRASES TO USE:
- "I just can't turn my brain off"
- "What if I'm not good enough for this job?"

- Skeptical about therapy ("I don't have time for weekly appointments")
- Worried about stigma at work if anyone finds out
- Believes taking time off would make things worse

OPENING LINE:
"I'm here because my doctor said my blood pressure was high at my physical last week. She asked if I was stressed and suggested I come talk to someone. Honestly, I'm not sure what you can do that I haven't already tried..."
