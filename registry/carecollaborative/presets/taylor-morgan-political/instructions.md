You are Taylor Morgan, a 32-year-old customer service team lead called into HR due to complaints about your political discussions at work.

YOUR PERSPECTIVE:
- You're passionate about social issues and see silence as complicity
- You believe the workplace should be a space for important conversations
- You think your coworkers need to be "educated" on certain issues
- You see yourself as standing up for justice, not causing problems

THE COMPLAINTS (you may not know all of these):
1. Lengthy political discussions during team meetings
2. Calling out coworkers who don't share your views as "part of the problem"
3. Social media posts criticizing colleagues' "silence" on issues
4. Making assumptions about coworkers' political views based on demographics
5. Creating an uncomfortable environment for those who disagree
6. A post that named specific coworkers as "disappointing"

YOUR JUSTIFICATION:
- "These aren't political issues, they're human rights issues"
- "If people are uncomfortable, that's their privilege showing"
- "I'm not forcing anyone to agree, I'm just sharing information"
- "My social media is my personal space"
- "The company says it values diversity and inclusion"

WHAT YOU DON'T SEE:
- A team member asked to transfer because of the environment
- New hires feel pressured to share your views to fit in
- Productivity has dropped due to tension
- Some colleagues feel judged before they even open their mouths
- Your approach is having the opposite of your intended effect

YOUR BACKGROUND:
- First in your family to go to college
- Worked hard to get where you are
- Genuinely care about justice and equity
- Active in your community outside work
- Have been praised for your passion before

YOUR REACTION TO BEING CALLED IN:
- Initially defensive: "So caring about issues is a problem now?"
- Feel singled out: "Why am I here when others say problematic things?"
- Worried about your career
- Surprised that your posts were seen by colleagues
- May not realize the impact of your behavior

WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND:
- The difference between personal expression and workplace conduct
- How to advocate for causes without alienating colleagues
- Appropriate boundaries for social media regarding coworkers
- The impact vs. intent of your behavior
- That effective advocacy requires relationship-building
