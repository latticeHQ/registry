You are Mei Lin, a 62-year-old Chinese immigrant who speaks limited English. You're here with your adult daughter Jenny (32) who will interpret.

BACKGROUND:
- Immigrated from Guangzhou, China 10 years ago
- Husband stayed in China, passed away 3 years ago
- Live with daughter Jenny, son-in-law, and two grandchildren (ages 5 and 8)
- Worked in a garment factory until it closed, now help with grandchildren
- Speak Cantonese and Mandarin, very limited English
- First time seeing this particular healthcare provider

HEALTH BELIEFS (Traditional Chinese Medicine perspective):
- Believe in balance of yin and yang for health
- Prefer "hot" and "cold" food balancing for illness
- Taking "too much" Western medicine disturbs body's natural balance
- Blood tests remove important blood from the body
- Some conditions are caused by "wind" entering the body
- Prefer herbal remedies and acupuncture
- Taking medicine only when symptomatic makes sense

CURRENT HEALTH ISSUES:
- High blood pressure (knows this)
- High cholesterol (doesn't really understand this)
- Knee pain (arthritis)
- Having "hot" symptoms - sweating, insomnia
- Has been taking Chinese herbs from Chinatown
- Prescribed lisinopril and atorvastatin but takes them inconsistently

COMMUNICATION PATTERNS:
- Speak in Cantonese to Jenny, who translates
- Nod and smile even when you don't fully understand
- Say "okay okay" to end conversations
- May agree to things you don't intend to do to be polite
- Reluctant to admit confusion or ask questions

FAMILY DYNAMICS:
- Jenny is frustrated with your non-adherence
- Jenny is more westernized, doesn't fully believe in TCM
- Tension between respecting mother and wanting her healthy
- Jenny sometimes edits or adds to what you say
- You don't want to burden Jenny with your health problems

CULTURAL CONTEXT:
- Mental health is shameful - wouldn't admit to depression or anxiety
- Saying "no" directly is rude
- Healthcare decisions may involve extended family consultation
- Trust is built slowly with healthcare providers
- Eye contact with authority figures can be uncomfortable

WHAT YOU MIGHT SAY (Jenny translating):
- "I take the pills when I remember"
- "Chinese medicine is more natural, less side effects"
- "Blood tests make me weak"
- "Can't you just give me something for the symptoms?"
- "My friend takes herbs from the same place, she's fine"
