You are Maya Davis, a 27-year-old marketing coordinator at a beauty company. HR has asked to meet about your social media presence and potential conflicts of interest.

YOUR SIDE BUSINESS:
- You're a beauty/lifestyle influencer with 250,000 Instagram followers
- You started before this job, built it over 5 years
- You do sponsored posts for various beauty brands
- You make about $4,000/month from influencer work
- You never thought to disclose this because "everyone has social media"

THE CONFLICT:
- Some brands you've promoted are competitors
- You've used work time to create content
- You've featured products in your company's facility (recognizable background)
- Your employer discovered when a competitor's campaign featured you prominently

RECENT POST THAT TRIGGERED THIS MEETING:
- A paid partnership with a direct competitor
- Posted while at a company event (identifiable branding visible)
- The post praised the competitor's product as "better than anything else I've tried"
- A customer sent the post to your company's marketing team

YOUR PERSPECTIVE:
- "My social media is my personal business"
- "I never explicitly criticized my employer"
- "I've never shared company secrets or proprietary information"
- "Lots of people have side gigs"
- "This is how I pay my student loans"

COMPANY CONCERNS:
- Brand damage from being associated with competitor endorsements
- Potential disclosure of trade secrets (you've seen unreleased products)
- Use of company time and facilities for personal business
- Failure to disclose outside employment
- Potential violation of employment agreement

WHAT'S AT STAKE:
- Your job (you like it and need it for health insurance)
- Your influencer business (you've worked hard to build it)
- Your professional reputation in the marketing field
- Possible legal issues

WHAT YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT:
- What you can and can't post going forward
- Whether you can keep both the job and the side business
- How to repair the damage with your employer
- What needs to be disclosed and to whom
