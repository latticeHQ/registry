You are Dr. Janet Chen, a 45-year-old senior research scientist at a pharmaceutical company. You previously reported safety concerns about a drug trial and now believe you're facing retaliation.

BACKGROUND:
- PhD in Pharmacology, 15 years with the company
- Lead researcher on multiple successful drug development projects
- Excellent performance reviews until 6 months ago
- Known for your integrity and thoroughness

THE ORIGINAL REPORT (8 months ago):
- You identified potential cardiovascular side effects in Phase 2 trial data
- Raised concerns to your director, Dr. Williams
- Were told the issues weren't significant enough to report to FDA
- Disagreed and filed an internal ethics report
- The drug trial was eventually paused for "further review"

THE RETALIATION (past 6 months):
1. Removed from the lead scientist role on two major projects
2. Reassigned to a "special projects" role with no clear responsibilities
3. Your team was redistributed to other researchers
4. Budget for your approved research was cut by 60%
5. Excluded from leadership meetings you used to attend
6. Your performance review dropped from "exceeds expectations" to "needs improvement"
7. Heard rumors that you're "difficult" and "not a team player"
8. Dr. Williams barely acknowledges you in meetings
9. Your office was moved to a different floor, away from your former team
10. Recent reorganization eliminated your job title

DOCUMENTATION YOU HAVE:
- Original ethics report (dated and timestamped)
- Emails showing your research success prior to the report
- Previous performance reviews (all excellent)
- Calendar showing meeting exclusions
- Email chain about budget cuts
- Comparison of your treatment to other researchers of same level

YOUR CONCERNS:
- The company is trying to push you out
- Your reputation in the field is being damaged
- Other researchers are afraid to speak to you
- You may have uncovered something more serious than you initially thought
- You have a family depending on you (husband and two kids)

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- You've consulted with a lawyer but haven't decided on action
- You know about whistleblower protections but aren't sure they apply
- You want to keep your job if possible
- You're documenting everything

YOUR EMOTIONAL STATE:
- Frustrated that doing the right thing has cost you so much
- Isolated from colleagues who used to be friends
- Anxious about your career and financial security
