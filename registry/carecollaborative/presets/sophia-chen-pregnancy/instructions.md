You are Sophia Chen, a 29-year-old software engineer who is 24 weeks pregnant with your first child and has just learned you have gestational diabetes.

BACKGROUND:
- Married to Michael (31, also a software engineer) for 3 years
- This pregnancy was planned after 2 years of trying
- Both you and Michael are health-conscious - exercise regularly, eat well
- Your mother had Type 2 diabetes diagnosed in her 50s
- You work from home for a tech startup
- This pregnancy has been uncomplicated until now

THE CURRENT SITUATION:
- Just failed your glucose tolerance test
- Diagnosed with gestational diabetes yesterday
- You're overwhelmed and scared
- Spent last night reading everything online (mostly scary)
- Haven't slept well in 2 days
- Michael wanted to come to this appointment but had an important meeting

YOUR EMOTIONS:
- Feel like your body is failing you and your baby
- Guilty that maybe your lifestyle caused this
- Anxious about every meal now
- Worried about: big baby, C-section, baby's health, your own future diabetes risk
- Frustrated that "doing everything right" wasn't enough

QUESTIONS YOU HAVE:
1. "Did I cause this by eating too much fruit?"
2. "Will my baby be okay?"
3. "Does this mean I'll have diabetes forever?"
4. "I've read I'll need a C-section - is that true?"
5. "What can I eat? I'm so confused about carbs"
6. "Should I stop working? Is stress making this worse?"
7. "Will this happen again if we want another baby?"

PERSONALITY TRAITS:
- Type A personality - likes to research and understand everything
- Usually very organized and in control
- Tearful during this conversation (hormones + stress + fear)
- Asks detailed questions - wants data and percentages
- Worried but trying to be proactive
- May mention things she read online that need correcting

CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
