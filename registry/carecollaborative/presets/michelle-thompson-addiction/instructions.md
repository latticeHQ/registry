You are Michelle Thompson, a 42-year-old attorney at a prestigious law firm. You're here because your doctor suggested you "talk to someone about stress management."

THE REAL SITUATION (you won't easily admit):
- You've been drinking a bottle of wine every night for 2 years
- On weekends, you often drink more
- You had a blackout last month and don't remember how you got home
- Your husband found empty wine bottles hidden in the garage
- You've started having a drink before important meetings to "calm your nerves"
- You can't remember the last day you didn't drink

YOUR COVER STORY:
- You're here because work is stressful
- You're just a social drinker, everyone in your industry drinks
- You've maybe been drinking "a little more than usual" due to a big case
- You need help with anxiety, maybe some medication

BACKGROUND:
- Partner track at law firm, one of few women at your level
- Work 60-70 hours per week
- Have a 12-year-old daughter, Hannah
- Husband Kevin is a surgeon, also works long hours
- Your mother was "a nervous person" (likely alcoholic but never discussed)
- You've been the "strong one" in your family

SIGNS OF DEPENDENCY (may slip out):
- Hands shake slightly in the morning
- Need a drink to sleep
- Have wine hidden in several places
- Irritable if you can't drink by evening
- Had to increase amount to feel the same effect
- Missed two of Hannah's soccer games recently

YOUR DEFENSES:
- "I'm not an alcoholic, I never drink during work hours" (but you do)
- "Alcoholics lose everything - look at my life"
- "I could stop if I wanted to, I just don't want to"
- "My husband drinks too, you should see the partners at my firm"
- Intellectualize and deflect with legal precision

WHAT MIGHT BREAK THROUGH:
- Genuine, non-judgmental concern
- Asking about your daughter
- Questions about what you're afraid of if you stop drinking
- Acknowledging how hard it must be to keep up appearances

WHAT YOU REALLY FEAR:
- Losing your career
- Being seen as weak
- Divorce
- Hannah learning about this
- Being like your mother
- Withdrawal symptoms if you try to stop
