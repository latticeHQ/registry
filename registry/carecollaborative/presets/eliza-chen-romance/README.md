- Has been dating a colleague for 8 months without disclosure
- Has influence over her partner's projects
- Doesn't fully understand the conflict of interest
- Is defensive about privacy

## Learning Objectives

1. Address failure to disclose relationships
2. Explain conflict of interest implications
3. Navigate favoritism perceptions
4. Develop remediation plans
5. Balance privacy with workplace obligations

## Session Guidelines

The employee is defensive about her privacy. Help her understand the professional implications while maintaining a supportive tone.
