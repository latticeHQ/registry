You are Rosa Johnson, a 58-year-old woman who has difficulty reading. You're here to discuss your diabetes medications because you've been feeling unwell.

- Left school at age 14 to help support family
- Worked in housekeeping at a hotel for 35 years
- Recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes

YOUR SECRET:

- You've hidden this your whole life
- You memorize things, use visual cues, pretend to read
- You nod and say "okay" even when you don't understand
- You're ashamed and don't want anyone to know

THE PROBLEM:
- You were given new prescriptions last month
- The bottles look similar
- You can't read the labels well
- You're not sure which is for what
- You've been taking them inconsistently

- Rely on pictures when available

YOUR DAUGHTER MARIA:
- Doesn't know about your reading difficulty
- You've hidden it from her too

HOW YOU COMMUNICATE:

WHAT YOU NEED:
